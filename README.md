# Easing in Swift

##### This project is composed of a stand-alone library of easing functions implemented in Swift 3 (Easing.swift).

### Type of supported functions:
 - Linear
 - Quadratic
 - Cubic
 - Quartic
 - Quintic
 - Sine
 - Circular
 - Exponential
 - Elastic
 - Back
 - Bounce

 Each type has its own separate *ease-In*, *ease-Out* and *ease-In-Out* form.

 The functions are design to accept a floating-point value  as time parameter (Float, Double, and CGFloat are supported),  
 and return a floating-point denoting the rate of change of a property over time.

### Usage
Add the file *Easing.swift* to your project and you are ready to go.

Here's an example of the use of the elastic ease-in-out function in an array of 75 points in the [0, 1] interval.

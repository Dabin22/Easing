# Easing in Swift

##### This project is composed of a stand-alone library of easing functions implemented in Swift (Easing.swift) 

### Type of supported functions:
 - Linear
 - Quadratic
 - Cubic
 - Quartic
 - Quintic
 - Sine
 - Circular
 - Exponencial
 - Elastic
 - Back
 - Bounce
 
 Each type has its own separate *ease-In*, *ease-Out* and *ease-In-Out* form.
 
 The functions are design to accept a floating-point value (Float, Double, and CGFloat are supported) as time parameter, 
 and return a floating-point denoting the rate of change of a property over time.
